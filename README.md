Bugs and how i solved them

- When I enlarged the quiz-section and the Harry Potter logo, it all pushed the content on top of the footer. This was not desired and I first tried to apply "padding-top: 60px;" in the footer to give it some space. This did not solve the issue since it created space for the footer, but it was not transparent like it sohuld be. But then I added "margin-top: 60px;" instead and this fixed the issue.
