Bugs and how i solved them

- When I enlarged the quiz-section and the Harry Potter logo, it all pushed the content on top of the footer. This was not desired and I first tried to apply "padding-top: 60px;" in the footer to give it some space. This did not solve the issue since it created space for the footer, but it was not transparent like it sohuld be. But then I added "margin-top: 60px;" instead and this fixed the issue.
  
- another problem was a UX/design problem and that was when I added the background colors for the buttons to green and red, it was disturbing to have a hover background color to white since it removed the red/green color. This resulted in the fact that if you answered correctly, the button did not turn green if you had your mouse/pointer on it. I removed the hover effect and I settled with a border-color instead.

- When I deployed my project, it all looked like it should on my desktop but on my phone the text in the buttons were blue but on the desktop version they were black. Apperently, IOS sets button colors to a initial blue color.
